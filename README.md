# GOOGLE KERAS DEEP LEARNING AI ALGORITHM FOR SOLVING MAZE

## overview
For this project I was given starter code for a treasure hunting maze game. The code I was given initialized a grid maze with various obsticles and one treasure location. My task was to program a reinforcement learning algorithm where the agent would be a non-player-computer pirate. The pirate's goal is to reach the treasure before the player. The pirate is incentivezed by a reward score that is increased for moves that brought it closer to the treasure, and decreased when the pirate collides with one of the obsticles in the maze. 
The pirate is given a "exploration factor" of 1 in 10. This allows for 1 non experience based exploration move per 10 experience based moves. The exploration factor ensures that the pirate will find the optimal path to the treasure and not get stuck with a convoluted path to the treasure. 

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create, update, and maintain the various servers, code, programs that our world runs on. 

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems by first thinking of the overall problem and all the implications and nuance of its design, thinking briefly on how I may go about tackling certain facets of the design and implementation. If it is a large project, I will begin my design, utilizing class diagrams, flowcharts, etc. to organize my thoughts and plan. Then I will begin to code the main functionality, updating and ensuring I'm following my design along the way. Finally I will test my program against my original design ensuring it meets the specifications. 

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibility is not only to refuse projects that I believe are wrong or could cause harm in some way. But also to ensure when I do complete a project that the code will meet and exceed the expectations of the end user and organize--that is, I must have the user and organization's best interest in mind.
